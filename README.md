# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes **100K+ hospital patient records** to evaluate **readmission rates** and identify risk factors.  
Using Excel PivotTables, XLOOKUP, and conditional logic, interactive dashboards were built to uncover insights into patient demographics, admission types, and discharge dispositions.

- 📊 Overall readmission distribution
- 👤 Gender-based analysis
- 🎂 Age group analysis
- 🏥 Admission type analysis
- 🏠 Discharge disposition analysis
- 📊 Two interactive dashboards (Overview & Process)

- Age **60–80** shows relatively higher short-term readmissions.  
- Gender differences are minimal but present (slightly higher in females).
